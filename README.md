Repository for the code of the projects from Udacity Deep Learning Foundation NanoDegree.

project1 - simple neural network implementation using Numpy. Input file contains data from bike sharing company. The aim of the project is to build a NN, that can predict daily bike rental ridership. 

project2 - Deep Convolutional Network applied to CIFAR-10.
