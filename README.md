Repository for the code of the projects from Udacity Deep Learning Foundation NanoDegree.

project1 - simple neural network implementation using Numpy. Input file contains data from bike sharing company. The aim of the project is to build a NN, that can predict daily bike rental ridership. 

project2 - Deep Convolutional Network applied to CIFAR-10.

project2/extra - Contains extensions of the project 2 - Convolutional Network with Inception Module as described in GoogLeNeT paper http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf and Residual Network (specifically, ResNet-50).

project_Anna_KaRNNa - intermediate project, that involved training characted-based LSTM RNN on Anna Karenina with subsequent text generation

project3 - TV script generation using RNN using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons

project4 - seq2seq neural network for English to French translation

project5 - face generation using DCGAN
