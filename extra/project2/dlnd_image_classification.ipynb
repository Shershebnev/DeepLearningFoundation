    "# Image Classification\n",
    "In this project, you'll classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).  The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded.  You'll get to apply what you learned and build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.  At the end, you'll get to see your neural network's predictions on the sample images.\n",

    "## Why 50-80% Accuracy?\n",
    "You might be wondering why you can't get an accuracy any higher. First things first, 50% isn't bad for a simple CNN.  Pure guessing would get you 10% accuracy. However, you might notice people are getting scores [well above 80%](http://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html#43494641522d3130).  That's because we haven't taught you all there is to know about neural networks. We still need to cover a few more techniques.\n",
